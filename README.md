### Heli's Programming corner

Dear reader,

My name is Heli, which has nothing to do with helicopters, the shape of DNA molecules or sun sourced elements.
In fact, my full name is Heliberto, but I like keeping it short and simple for non-spanish speakers.

Now that we cleared that out: Hi, my name is Heli.

I am a man of many passions. I like science. I enjoy experiencing space (as in using my spatial intelligence
in daily life), I'm a big fan of flying things (mostly aeroplanes but, drones, birds, paper planes, helicopters, ...) and that
may be reflected in my projects. I like music (everyone does, yes), but I like instruments, making things that
sound harmonically good. Liking is one thing, but trying and succeeding is something else.

I also have an addiction for programming (I would like to have my brain scanned while I code in different languages
to see what it compares to ...) sorry; I took the wrong turn.

I don't have formal education in programming. I have enough grasp of the art as to say that it's not about
the language you use and how much you know about its details; reference manuals can solve that.

I would like to develop my ability to imagine exactly what I want, split it into simpler logical modules
that have well defined properties, see it working and them, write the code for it. I've started as a
<i>brute force</i> programmer, where I try to plan short sighted while I code. That's slowly changing.
I would also like to learn how to do it within a team of people; this is how you, reader, see me here at
Github.

Electronics are also part of the list of passions.To me it was a natural step from learning programming and,
increasingly, lower level languages, such as C, assembly and lately Forth; I wanted to know what supports the
show.
