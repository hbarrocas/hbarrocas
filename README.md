### Heli's Programming corner

Dear reader,

My name is Heli, which has nothing to do with helicopters, the shape of DNA molecules or sun sourced elements.
In fact, my full name is Heliberto, but I like keeping it short and simple for non-spanish speakers.

Now that we cleared that out: Hi, my name is Heli.

I am a man of many passions. I like science. I enjoy experiencing space (as in using my spatial intelligence
in daily life), I'm a big fan of flying things (mostly aeroplanes but, drones, birds, paper planes, helicopters, ...) and that
may be reflected in my projects. I like music (everyone does, yes), but I like instruments, making things that
sound harmonically good. Liking is one thing, but trying and succeeding is something else.

I also have an addiction for programming. Some languages hit harder than others. Sometimes it's the project, not the language, but bringing algorithms to life is always a big producer of endorfins for me!

I don't have formal education in programming. Lucky for me, the internet has provided for everything I needed to keep learning. Free software has also played a big role in my developement. I owe the Free Software community a lot.
